<h2>Description</h2>

<p>When you choose a ticket, you look not only at a particular seat but also the cost. Let's implement the ability to check the ticket price.</p>

<h2>Objectives</h2>

<p>A seat cost can vary from 0.5 for farther rows to 1.5 for closer rows from the base ticket cost. Seats in the middle have the base ticket cost. Other values should be interpolated.</p>

<p>For example, we have 10 rows with a base ticket cost of 10. The farthest row cost is 5 per seat, and the closer row is 15 per seat. Let's interpolate [5, 15] range between 10 steps. The result is [6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15] because our friends want to maximize the income.</p>

<p>Show a ticket price when you click on a seat in <code>Toast</code>.</p>
