<h2>Description</h2>

<p>Good job! Your friends really liked your app! Now they want to expand their app by adding a new wholesome feature, called <strong>profit</strong>. This feature depends on the movie duration, ratings, and available seats in the cinema room. It defines the best cinema session. Help them calculate profit from the current session, and, maybe, let them raise the ticket cost for popular movies.</p>

<h2>Objectives</h2>

<p>In this stage, you need to read two positive numbers from the activity intent property: movie duration in minutes (under the <code>DURATION</code> string key) and the movie rating from 0 until 5 (under the <code>RATING</code> string key). The ticket price is determined by the following rules:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Let's assume that the best movie duration is 90 minutes. So, take the following formula for predicting profit: <span class="math-tex">\[y = -{1 \over 90} x^2 +2x + 90\]</span>where <span class="math-tex">\(x\)</span> is movie duration in minutes, and <span class="math-tex">\(y\)</span> is <code>movie_duration_profit</code>;</li>
	<li>The base formula for the ticket price is (<em>rating </em><em>* movie_duration_profit) / available_seats</em>;</li>
	<li>If the rating isn't in the intent, consider it 4.5f;</li>
	<li>If the movie duration isn't in the intent, consider it 108;</li>
	<li>The calculation result should be as follows: <code>Estimated ticket price: your-value-here$</code> and put in <code>TextView</code> with <code>cinema_room_ticket_price</code> id.</li>
	<li>The calculation result should be as follows: <code>Estimated ticket price: your-value-here$</code> and put in <code>TextView</code> with <code>cinema_room_ticket_price</code> id.</li>
</ul>

<p> </p>
