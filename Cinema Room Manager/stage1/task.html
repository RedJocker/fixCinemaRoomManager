<h2>Description</h2>

<p>There are many fun activities on the planet Earth, and one of them is going to the movies. It is arguably the most accessible, inclusive, and fulfilling entertainment. Bring your friends or loved ones — each movie is a whole new adventure waiting to be experienced.</p>

<p>As a beginner developer, you can contribute to this wonderful cinema experience. Your good friends asked you to help them with an Android application for a cinema theatre where people can get tickets, reserve seats, and enjoy a movie. </p>

<h2>Objectives</h2>

<p>Our cinema theatre cannot admit a lot of people, so you need to take into account the restrictions on the number of seats. Your friends said that the room can have 7 rows of 8 seats max. Your task is to help them visualize the seating arrangement by using <code>GridLayout</code> for setting seats and a screen before seats.</p>

<p>For test purposes, your screen view should have the <code>cinema_room_screen_text</code> id and the <code>Screen</code> string. Your <code>GridLayout</code> should have the <code>cinema_room_places</code><strong><em> </em></strong>id. Each place should have the <code>cinema_room_place_item_text</code> id with the <code>"$row.$seat"</code> string.</p>

<h2>Example</h2>

<p><strong>Example 1:</strong> <em>an example of your application</em></p>
