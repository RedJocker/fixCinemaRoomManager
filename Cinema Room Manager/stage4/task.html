<h2>Description</h2>

<p>Our venue is getting really popular. Customers now want to purchase tickets right from the app. Let's add a dialog box that will allow them to do it. Don't forget to display the current state of the reserved seating.</p>

<p>The best approach is to use DialogFragment that allows to easily avoid memory leaks and other issues with properly state handling due to device rotations and other android stuff.</p>

<p>Anyway, under the hood, it uses a default android.app.AlertDialog, so let's use it to avoid compatibility issues</p>

<h2>Objectives</h2>

<p>A click on the seat should display a dialog that contains a ticket price and two options: buy a ticket or cancel the purchase. If the ticket is already reserved, no dialog option should be available. For a better user experience, let's color seats in the cinema room. Make available seats green and booked seats gray.<br>
<br>
1) The <code>AlertDialog</code> title should have a row and a seat number. An example template: <code>Buy a ticket 1 row 6 seat</code>;</p>

<p>2) The <code>AlertDialog</code> message should contain a ticket price. An example template: <code>Your ticket price is 24.11$</code>;</p>

<p>3) The <code>AlertDialog</code> should have a positive button with the <code>Buy a ticket</code> text;</p>

<p>4) The <code>AlertDialog</code> should have a <strong>negative</strong> button with the <code>Cancel purchase</code> text;</p>

<p>5) The booked seat should be disabled. The seat indicator <code>R.id.cinema_room_place_indicator</code> should be of the <code>CardView</code> type with a gray color (<strong>Color.DKGRAY</strong> or <strong>android.R.color.darker_gray</strong>) background. Use the <code>setCardBackgroundColor</code> method to set up a proper property.</p>
